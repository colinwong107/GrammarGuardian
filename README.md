I developed an AI-powered GPT chatbot that utilizes React for front-end development and Python for back-end integration, aimed at providing real-time grammar checking within a web application.
By integrating OpenAI's GPT models, the chatbot analyzes and provides real-time responses to user inputs, accurately identifying grammatical errors.
if the input sentence is grammatically correct, it outputs "Correct," and if incorrect, it explains the error and suggests the correct sentence structure.
Additionally, I deployed the application using AWS Cloud service to ensure scalable, reliable access and continuous availability for users.
